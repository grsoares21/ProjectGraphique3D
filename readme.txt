-This folder contains all the files containing the classes and data used in the 3D Graphics Dragon Project
-The projects was made using qt, so to compile it and run it is necessary to use the following commands:
	* qmake cg3D.pro
	* make
-The resulting program is a executable called cg3D
-The main scene displays a castle room with pillars and torches. 
-In the middle of the room there's an angry dragon who just broke his chain so he could reach a teapot and boil some water for a tea.
-To allow him to do it, press ENTER

The main achievements in this project were:
*To create a quite realistic walk and flying animation, otherwise the dragon would never reach the teapot. 
*To be able to load and display the textures which gave us some trouble working with the shaders, otherwise the castle room would be just a room and the green scaled dragon would be just a green dragon.
*To use a Phong shader to make the teapot shinny, otherwise the dragon would never find the teapot since his vision is a bit limited due to his small eyes.
*To create a particles based system for the fire and smoke, otherwise the dragon would never be able to throw fire in the teapot neither he would know if the water is already boiling.
